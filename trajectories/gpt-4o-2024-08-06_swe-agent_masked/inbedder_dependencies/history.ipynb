    "```\n",
    "!ls -a\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\n",
    "If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command. \n",
    "You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\n",

She was the first Chinese citizen to win a Nobel Prize in science for her work in helping to create an anti-malaria  medicine.\nIn 1967, Communist leader Mao Zedong decided there was an urgent national need to find a cure for malaria. At the time, malaria spread by mosquitoes was killing Chinese soldiers fighting Americans in the jungles of northern Vietnam. A secret research unit was formed to find a cure for the illness. Two years later, Tu Youyou was instructed to become the new head of Mission 523. Researchers in Mission523 _ ancient books to find historical methods of fighting malaria. When she started her search for an anti-malarial drug, over 240,000 compounds  around the world had already been tested, without any success.\nFinally, the team found a brief reference to one substance, sweet wormwood , which had been used to treat malaria in China around 400 AD. The team isolated one active compound in wormwood, artemisinin , which appeared to battle malaria-friendly parasites . The team then tested extracts  of the compound but nothing was effective until Tu Youyou returned to the original ancient text. After another careful reading, she improved the drug recipe one final time, heating the extract without allowing it to reach boiling point.\nAfter the drug showed promising results in mice and monkeys, Tu volunteered to be the first human recipient of the new drug. \"As the head of the research group, I had the responsibility.\" she explained.\n\n### Response:\nWARNING:root:Tokenizing inputs...

At the time, malaria spread by mosquitoes was killing Chinese soldiers fighting Americans in the jungles of northern Vietnam. A secret research unit was formed to find a cure for the illness. Two years later, Tu Youyou was instructed to become the new head of Mission 523. Researchers in Mission523 _ ancient books to find historical methods of fighting malaria. When she started her search for an anti-malarial drug, over 240,000 compounds  around the world had already been tested, without any success.\nFinally, the team found a brief reference to one substance, sweet wormwood , which had been used to treat malaria in China around 400 AD. The team isolated one active compound in wormwood, artemisinin , which appeared to battle malaria-friendly parasites . The team then tested extracts  of the compound but nothing was effective until Tu Youyou returned to the original ancient text. After another careful reading, she improved the drug recipe one final time, heating the extract without allowing it to reach boiling point.\nAfter the drug showed promising results in mice and monkeys, Tu volunteered to be the first human recipient of the new drug. \"As the head of the research group, I had the responsibility.\" she explained.\n\n### Response:\nWARNING:root:Tokenizing inputs...
