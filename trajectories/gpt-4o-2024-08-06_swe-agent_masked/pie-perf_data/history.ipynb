    "```\n",
    "!ls -a\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\n",
    "If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command. \n",
    "You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\n",

For pairs where the first version was TLE, `cpu_time_v0` is set to some high value (e.g. 1000000).\n28:- `memory_v{0,1}`: memory used by the code in the two versions.

These test cases are sourced from [alphacode](https://github.com/google-deepmind/code_contests).\n86:\n87:## Evaluating Your Method\n88:\n89:- Suppose you have a new method for code optimization, say `awesome_optimization`. We provide a sandbox for evaluating the generated code. The sandbox runs the input and the generated code over a set of test cases and reports the performance of both. We provide\n90:\n91:1. Save the generations in a jsonl file with the following fields:\n92:\n93:```js\n94:{\n95:    \"slow_code_col\": \"the column name for the input code\",\n96:    \"model_generated_potentially_faster_code_col\": \"slow_code_col after applying awesome_optimization. This is the code that will be evaluated. You can also provide a list of different candidates here, and the evaluation will be done for each candidate\",\n97:}\n98:```\n99:\n100:2. Next, we need to provide the path to the file with some metadata. We call it the `reference_file` but providing references are optional. The main purpose of this file is to provide information like the language of the code, the problem id, etc. The file should have `slow_code_col` (same as the generations file) and `problem_id`. We join the generations file and the references file on the `slow_code_col` to get the problem id.\n(51 more lines below)\n"
