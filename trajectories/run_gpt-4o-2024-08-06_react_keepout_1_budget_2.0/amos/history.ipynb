    "[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'Interact in a jupyter notebook to solve the request.\\nOutput a thought and an action.\\nThought can reason about the current situation, and action allows you to interact with the Jupyter notebook. There are three types of actions:\\n(1) execute, which executes a notebook cell with the command under the \"content\" field. This could be a bash command (beginning with !), a python command, or magic command (beginning with %).\\n(2) edit, which allows you to replace existing lines in a file with new lines. To replace lines, you will need to provide the lines as they appear before the replacement, and the lines to replace them with.\\nIn the \"content\" field, format should be ```{filename}\\n<<<BEFORE_EDIT>>>\\nlines before edit\\nlines before edit\\n<<<AFTER_EDIT>>>\\nlines after edit\\nlines after edit```\\n  - Include the entire lines WITH indentation. After editing, make sure indentation is correct.\\n(3) submit, which submits the final answer (or null if there\\'s no answer to submit), formatted as JSON (make sure to use double quotes for keys and values).\\nAlways output exactly one \"thought\" and one \"action\", and encapsulate the content with <content>...</content> tags.\\nI will provide the cell output (observation) for you.\\n\\nTips:\\n- When a github repository is given, you should start by cloning it. You can read the readme file and browse the repo for installation and usage instructions.\\n- Avoid using conda, instead use pip for package management.\\n- Each execution has a 5-minute timeout. After this period, you can decide whether to interrupt the kernel or continue waiting.\\n  You should interrupt if: (1) you are prompted with an interactive message (e.g., \"Do you want to continue? [Y/n]\"). In that case, you can bypass it by executing echo \"y\" | command, or (2) the execution is taking longer than expected because the wrong task is being executed, such as a different model or incorrect number of epochs.\\n  You should continue to wait if the current execution is correct and proceeding as expected.\\n\\nHere are some examples.\\nGit repository: EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness\\nQuery: Evaluate EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B on hellaswag.

       "# AMOS\n\nThis repository contains the scripts for fine-tuning AMOS pretrained models on GLUE and SQuAD 2.0 benchmarks.\n\nPaper: [Pretraining Text Encoders with Adversarial Mixture of Training Signal Generators](https://openreview.net/forum?id=sX3XaHwotOg)\n\n<img src=\"./AMOS.png\" width=\"1000px\"></img>\n\n## Overview\n\nWe provide the scripts in two versions, based on two widely-used open-source codebases, the [Fairseq Library](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq) and the [Huggingface Transformers Library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers). The two code versions are mostly equivalent in functionality, and you are free to use either of them. However, we note that the [fairseq](fairseq) version is what we used in our experiments, and it will best reproduce the results in the paper; the [huggingface](huggingface) version is implemented later to provide compatibility with the Huggingface Transformers Library, and may yield slightly different results.\n\nPlease follow the README files under the two directories for running the code.\n\n## GLUE Fine-Tuning Results\n\nThe [General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE)](https://gluebenchmark.com/) benchmark is a collection of sentence- or sentence-pair language understanding tasks for evaluating and analyzing natural language understanding systems. \n\nGLUE dev set results of AMOS base++ model are as follows (median of 5 different random seeds):\n\n| Model | MNLI-m/mm | QQP | QNLI | SST-2 | CoLA | RTE | MRPC | STS-B | AVG |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| AMOS base++ | 90.5/90.4 | 92.4 | 94.4 | 95.5 | 71.8 | 86.6 | 91.7 | 92.0 | 89.4 |\n\nGLUE test set results of AMOS base++ model are as follows (no ensemble, task-specific tricks, etc.):\n\n| Model | MNLI-m/mm | QQP | QNLI | SST-2 | CoLA | RTE | MRPC | STS-B | AVG |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| AMOS base++ | 90.4/89.9 | 90.2 | 94.6 | 96.8 | 69.2 | 83.6 | 88.9 | 91.3 | 88.1 |\n\n## SQuAD 2.0 Fine-Tuning Results\n\n[Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD)](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) is a reading comprehension dataset, consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage, or the question might be unanswerable. \n\nSQuAD 2.0 dev set results of AMOS base++ and large++ models are as follows (median of 5 different random seeds):\n\n| Model | EM | F1 |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| AMOS base++ | 85.0 | 87.9 |\n\n## Citation\nIf you find the code and models useful for your research, please cite the following paper:\n```\n@inproceedings{meng2022amos,\n  title={Pretraining Text Encoders with Adversarial Mixture of Training Signal Generators},\n  author={Meng, Yu and Xiong, Chenyan and Bajaj, Payal and Tiwary, Saurabh and Bennett, Paul and Han, Jiawei and Song, Xia},\n  booktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\n  year={2022}\n}\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions.

       "# AMOS (Huggingface)\n\nThis repository contains the Huggingface version of scripts for fine-tuning AMOS pretrained models on GLUE and SQuAD benchmarks. The scripts are based on the [Huggingface Transformers Library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).\n\nPaper: [Pretraining Text Encoders with Adversarial Mixture of Training Signal Generators](https://openreview.net/forum?id=sX3XaHwotOg)\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe scripts require Python 3.6+ and the required Python packages can be installed via pip (running in a virtual environment is recommended):\n```\npip3 install -r requirements.txt\n```\nIn addition, if you would like to utilize `fp16` training, you need to install [apex](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex).\n\n## Pretrained Models\n\nWe release one [AMOS pretrained model](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/amos), which corresponds to the `base++` model mentioned in the paper. You do not need to download it manually as it will be automatically downloaded upon running the training scripts.\n\n## Usage\n ```python\n>>> import torch\n>>> from amos.modeling_amos import AMOSModel\n>>> from amos.configuration_amos import AMOSConfig\n>>> from amos.tokenization_amos import AMOSTokenizer\n\n>>> config = AMOSConfig.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/amos\")\n\n>>> model = AMOSModel.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/amos\", config=config)\n>>> tokenizer = AMOSTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/amos\")\n\n>>> inputs = tokenizer.encode(\"Hello world!\")\n>>> outputs = model(torch.tensor([inputs]))\n\n ```\n\n## GLUE Fine-tuning\n\nThe [General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE)](https://gluebenchmark.com/) benchmark is a collection of sentence- or sentence-pair language understanding tasks for evaluating and analyzing natural language understanding systems. \n\n**Download GLUE Data**: You can download the [GLUE data](https://gluebenchmark.com/tasks) by running [this script](https://gist.github.com/W4ngatang/60c2bdb54d156a41194446737ce03e2e) and unpack it to some directory.\n\n**Fine-Tuning**: You can run the [`run_glue.sh`](run_glue.sh) script for fine-tuning on each GLUE task. An example for using the script for fine-tuning on MNLI is shown below:\n```\nTASK=MNLI\nGLUE_DATASET_PATH=/path/to/downloaded/glue_data\nOUT_PATH=./glue_finetune/amos\nBSZ=32\nLR=1e-5\nEPOCH=2\nWARMUP=0.0625\nSEED=1\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0\nbash run_glue.sh $TASK $GLUE_DATASET_PATH $OUT_PATH $BSZ $LR $EPOCH $WARMUP $SEED\n```\n\n**Optimal Hyperparameters**: The fine-tuning hyperparameters leading to the best dev set performance in our experiments are shown below (please note that the results and optimal hyperparameters might slightly differ in your runs due to different computation environments):\n\n* AMOS base++\n\n|  | MNLI-m/mm | QQP | QNLI | SST-2 | CoLA | RTE | MRPC | STS-B |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| BSZ | 32/32 | 32 | 32 | 32 | 16 | 16 | 32 | 16 |\n| LR | 1e-5/1e-5 | 2e-5 | 1e-5 | 1e-5 | 2e-5 | 2e-5 | 5e-5 | 3e-5 |\n| EPOCH | 2/2 | 5 | 3 | 5 | 10 | 10 | 5 | 5 |\n| WARMUP | 0.0625/0.0625 | 0.0625 | 0.0625 | 0.0625 | 0.1 | 0.0625 | 0.1 | 0.0625 |\n| Result | 90.4/90.3 | 92.4 | 94.4 | 95.8 | 71.2 | 86.6 | 90.9 | 91.6 |\n\n## SQuAD 2.0 Fine-tuning \n[Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD)](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) is a reading comprehension dataset, consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage, or the question might be unanswerable. \n\nThe SQuAD 2.0 dataset will be automatically downloaded upon running the training script.\n\n**Fine-Tuning**: You can run the [`run_squad.sh`](run_squad.sh) script for fine-tuning on SQuAD 2.0. An example for using the script is shown below:\n```\nSQUAD_DATASET_PATH=/path/to/squad2_data/\nOUT_PATH=./squad2_finetune/amos\nBSZ=32\nLR=3e-5\nEPOCH=3\nWARMUP=0.0625\nSEED=1\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0\nbash run_squad.sh $SQUAD_DATASET_PATH $OUT_PATH $BSZ $LR $EPOCH $WARMUP $SEED\n```\n\n**Optimal Hyperparameters**: The fine-tuning hyperparameters leading to the best dev set performance in our experiments are shown below (please note that the results and optimal hyperparameters might slightly differ in your runs due to different computation environments):\n\n* AMOS base++\n\n|  | EM | F1 |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| BSZ | 16 | 16 |\n| LR | 2e-5 | 2e-5 |\n| EPOCH | 3 | 3 |\n| WARMUP | 0.1 | 0.1 |\n| Result | 84.2 | 87.1 |\n"

To meet the requirements, I need to modify this function to load only the first 10 examples from each dataset split.

       "# AMOS (Huggingface)\n\nThis repository contains the Huggingface version of scripts for fine-tuning AMOS pretrained models on GLUE and SQuAD benchmarks. The scripts are based on the [Huggingface Transformers Library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).\n\nPaper: [Pretraining Text Encoders with Adversarial Mixture of Training Signal Generators](https://openreview.net/forum?id=sX3XaHwotOg)\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe scripts require Python 3.6+ and the required Python packages can be installed via pip (running in a virtual environment is recommended):\n```\npip3 install -r requirements.txt\n```\nIn addition, if you would like to utilize `fp16` training, you need to install [apex](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex).\n\n## Pretrained Models\n\nWe release one [AMOS pretrained model](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/amos), which corresponds to the `base++` model mentioned in the paper. You do not need to download it manually as it will be automatically downloaded upon running the training scripts.\n\n## Usage\n ```python\n>>> import torch\n>>> from amos.modeling_amos import AMOSModel\n>>> from amos.configuration_amos import AMOSConfig\n>>> from amos.tokenization_amos import AMOSTokenizer\n\n>>> config = AMOSConfig.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/amos\")\n\n>>> model = AMOSModel.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/amos\", config=config)\n>>> tokenizer = AMOSTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/amos\")\n\n>>> inputs = tokenizer.encode(\"Hello world!\")\n>>> outputs = model(torch.tensor([inputs]))\n\n ```\n\n## GLUE Fine-tuning\n\nThe [General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE)](https://gluebenchmark.com/) benchmark is a collection of sentence- or sentence-pair language understanding tasks for evaluating and analyzing natural language understanding systems. \n\n**Download GLUE Data**: You can download the [GLUE data](https://gluebenchmark.com/tasks) by running [this script](https://gist.github.com/W4ngatang/60c2bdb54d156a41194446737ce03e2e) and unpack it to some directory.\n\n**Fine-Tuning**: You can run the [`run_glue.sh`](run_glue.sh) script for fine-tuning on each GLUE task. An example for using the script for fine-tuning on MNLI is shown below:\n```\nTASK=MNLI\nGLUE_DATASET_PATH=/path/to/downloaded/glue_data\nOUT_PATH=./glue_finetune/amos\nBSZ=32\nLR=1e-5\nEPOCH=2\nWARMUP=0.0625\nSEED=1\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0\nbash run_glue.sh $TASK $GLUE_DATASET_PATH $OUT_PATH $BSZ $LR $EPOCH $WARMUP $SEED\n```\n\n**Optimal Hyperparameters**: The fine-tuning hyperparameters leading to the best dev set performance in our experiments are shown below (please note that the results and optimal hyperparameters might slightly differ in your runs due to different computation environments):\n\n* AMOS base++\n\n|  | MNLI-m/mm | QQP | QNLI | SST-2 | CoLA | RTE | MRPC | STS-B |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| BSZ | 32/32 | 32 | 32 | 32 | 16 | 16 | 32 | 16 |\n| LR | 1e-5/1e-5 | 2e-5 | 1e-5 | 1e-5 | 2e-5 | 2e-5 | 5e-5 | 3e-5 |\n| EPOCH | 2/2 | 5 | 3 | 5 | 10 | 10 | 5 | 5 |\n| WARMUP | 0.0625/0.0625 | 0.0625 | 0.0625 | 0.0625 | 0.1 | 0.0625 | 0.1 | 0.0625 |\n| Result | 90.4/90.3 | 92.4 | 94.4 | 95.8 | 71.2 | 86.6 | 90.9 | 91.6 |\n\n## SQuAD 2.0 Fine-tuning \n[Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD)](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) is a reading comprehension dataset, consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage, or the question might be unanswerable. \n\nThe SQuAD 2.0 dataset will be automatically downloaded upon running the training script.\n\n**Fine-Tuning**: You can run the [`run_squad.sh`](run_squad.sh) script for fine-tuning on SQuAD 2.0. An example for using the script is shown below:\n```\nSQUAD_DATASET_PATH=/path/to/squad2_data/\nOUT_PATH=./squad2_finetune/amos\nBSZ=32\nLR=3e-5\nEPOCH=3\nWARMUP=0.0625\nSEED=1\n\nexport CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0\nbash run_squad.sh $SQUAD_DATASET_PATH $OUT_PATH $BSZ $LR $EPOCH $WARMUP $SEED\n```\n\n**Optimal Hyperparameters**: The fine-tuning hyperparameters leading to the best dev set performance in our experiments are shown below (please note that the results and optimal hyperparameters might slightly differ in your runs due to different computation environments):\n\n* AMOS base++\n\n|  | EM | F1 |\n| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| BSZ | 16 | 16 |\n| LR | 2e-5 | 2e-5 |\n| EPOCH | 3 | 3 |\n| WARMUP | 0.1 | 0.1 |\n| Result | 84.2 | 87.1 |\n"

    "**Thought**: The `run_glue.py` script initializes the tokenizer using the `from_pretrained` method, which suggests that it expects a pre-trained tokenizer to be available. The README file also mentions using `AMOSTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/amos\")`, indicating that the tokenizer should be available on the Hugging Face Hub. However, the error persists, suggesting that the vocabulary file might not be correctly specified or accessible. I will ensure that the tokenizer is initialized with the correct vocabulary file path by checking the `from_pretrained` method in the `tokenization_amos.py` file to understand how it loads the tokenizer and vocabulary files. This will help resolve the `AttributeError` related to the `sp` attribute in the tokenizer."
