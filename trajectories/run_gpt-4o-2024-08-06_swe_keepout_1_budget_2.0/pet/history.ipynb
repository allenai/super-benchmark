The papers introduce pattern-exploiting training (PET), a semi-supervised training procedure that reformulates input examples as cloze-style phrases. In low-resource settings, PET and iPET significantly outperform regular supervised training, various semi-supervised baselines and even GPT-3 despite requiring 99.9% less parameters. The iterative variant of PET (iPET) trains multiple generations of models and can even be used without any training data.\n4:\n5:<table>\n6:    <tr>\n7:        <th>#Examples</th>\n8:        <th>Training Mode</th>\n9:        <th>Yelp (Full)</th>\n10:        <th>AG's News</th>\n11:        <th>Yahoo Questions</th>\n12:        <th>MNLI</th>\n13:    </tr>\n14:    <tr>\n15:        <td rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"><b>0</b></td>\n16:        <td>unsupervised</td>\n17:        <td align=\"right\">33.8</td>\n18:        <td align=\"right\">69.5</td>\n19:        <td align=\"right\">44.0</td>\n20:        <td align=\"right\">39.1</td>\n21:    </tr>\n22:    <tr>\n23:        <td>iPET</td>\n24:        <td align=\"right\"><b>56.7</b></td>\n25:        <td align=\"right\"><b>87.5</b></td>\n26:        <td align=\"right\"><b>70.7</b></td>\n27:        <td align=\"right\"><b>53.6</b></td>\n28:    </tr>\n29:    <tr>\n30:        <td rowspan=\"3\" align=\"center\"><b>100</b></td>\n31:        <td>supervised</td>\n32:        <td align=\"right\">53.0</td>\n33:        <td align=\"right\">86.0</td>\n34:        <td align=\"right\">62.9</td>\n35:        <td align=\"right\">47.9</td>\n36:    </tr>\n37:    <tr>\n38:        <td>PET</td>\n39:        <td align=\"right\">61.9</td>\n40:        <td align=\"right\">88.3</td>\n41:        <td align=\"right\">69.2</td>\n42:        <td align=\"right\">74.7</td>\n43:    </tr>\n44:    <tr>\n45:        <td>iPET</td>\n46:        <td align=\"right\"><b>62.9</b></td>\n47:        <td align=\"right\"><b>89.6</b></td>\n48:        <td align=\"right\"><b>71.2</b></td>\n49:        <td align=\"right\"><b>78.4</b></td>\n50:    </tr>\n51:</table>\n52:    \n53:<sup>*Note*: To exactly reproduce the above results, make sure to use v1.1.0 (`--branch v1.1.0`).</sup>\n54:\n55:## 📑 Contents\n56:\n57:**[🔧 Setup](#-setup)**\n58:\n59:**[💬 CLI Usage](#-cli-usage)**\n60:\n61:**[💻 API Usage](#-api-usage)**\n62:\n63:**[🐶 Train your own PET](#-train-your-own-pet)**\n64:\n65:**[📕 Citation](#-citation)**\n66:\n67:## 🔧 Setup\n68:\n69:All requirements for PET can be found in `requirements.txt`.

For Yelp Reviews, AG's News, Yahoo Questions, MNLI and X-Stance, see [the original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07676) for further details. For the 8 SuperGLUE tasks, see [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07118).\n74:\n75:### PET Training and Evaluation\n76:\n77:To train and evaluate a PET model for one of the supported tasks, simply run the following command:\n78:\n79:    python3 cli.py \\\n80:\t--method pet \\\n81:\t--pattern_ids $PATTERN_IDS \\\n82:\t--data_dir $DATA_DIR \\\n83:\t--model_type $MODEL_TYPE \\\n84:\t--model_name_or_path $MODEL_NAME_OR_PATH \\\n85:\t--task_name $TASK \\\n86:\t--output_dir $OUTPUT_DIR \\\n87:\t--do_train \\\n88:\t--do_eval\n89:    \n90: where\n91: - `$PATTERN_IDS` specifies the PVPs to use. For example, if you want to use *all* patterns, specify `PATTERN_IDS 0 1 2 3 4` for AG's News and Yahoo Questions or `PATTERN_IDS 0 1 2 3` for Yelp Reviews and MNLI.\n92: - `$DATA_DIR` is the directory containing the train and test files (check `tasks.py` to see how these files should be named and formatted for each task).\n93: - `$MODEL_TYPE` is the name of the model being used, e.g. `albert`, `bert` or `roberta`.\n94: - `$MODEL_NAME` is the name of a pretrained model (e.g., `roberta-large` or `albert-xxlarge-v2`) or the path to a pretrained model.\n95: - `$TASK_NAME` is the name of the task to train and evaluate on.\n96: - `$OUTPUT_DIR` is the name of the directory in which the trained model and evaluation results are saved.\n97: \n98:You can additionally specify various training parameters for both the ensemble of PET models corresponding to individual PVPs (prefix `--pet_`) and for the final sequence classification model (prefix `--sc_`). For example, the default parameters used for our SuperGLUE evaluation are:\n99: \n100: \t--pet_per_gpu_eval_batch_size 8 \\\n(168 more lines below)\n"
