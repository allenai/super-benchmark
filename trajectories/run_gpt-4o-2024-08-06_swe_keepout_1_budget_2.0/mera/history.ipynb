Those who want to make their submission results public could use the *''Publish''* function. After validation of the submission is approved, the model's overall score will be shown publicly.*\n96:*The parameters of the generation, prompts and few-shot/zero-shot are fixed. You can vary them for your own purposes. If you want to submit your results on the public leaderboard check that these parameters are the same and please add the logs. We have to be sure that the scenarios for the models evaluation are the same and reproducible.*\n97:\n98:We provide the [sample submission](modules/scoring/examples) for you to check the format.\n99:\n100:The process of the whole MERA evaluation is described on the Figure:\n(26 more lines below)\n"

MERA supposes to run tasks with the following fewshot count:\n72:* `--num_fewshot=0` (zeroshot) with `multiq`, `parus`, `rcb`, `rumodar`, `rwsd`, `use`, `rudetox`, `ruethics`,\n73:`ruhatespeech`, `ruhhh`, `rutie`, and `ruhumaneval`;\n74:* `--num_fewshot=2` with `bps` and `lcs`;\n75:* `--num_fewshot=4` with `chegeka`;\n76:* `--num_fewshot=5` with `mathlogicqa`, `ruworldtree`, `ruopenbookqa`, `simplear`, `rumultiar`, and `rummlu`.\n77:\n78:Use `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to set cuda device visibility (setting `--device cuda:3` works inconsistently).\n79:\n80:`--model hf-causal-experimental` is used for models compatible with transformers' `AutoModelForCausalLM` class\n81:and `hf-seq2seq` is used for models compatible with transformers' `AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM` class.\n82:\n83:`--model_args` is for comma separated parameters of `from_pretrained` method of autoclass. One should be aware of\n84:hardware requirements to run big models and limit the maximum input length of models with the parameter `max_length`\n85:to avoid out-of-memory errors during a run.\n86:\n87:`--batch_size=1` is set to use a batch size of 1 to maximize benchmark results reproducibility.\n88:`--batch_size=auto` may be set to determine a batch size automatically based on the evaluated tasks and inputs maximum value\n89:to start to search down is set with `--max_batch_size`. Bigger batches may speed up running the whole MERA benchmark,\n90:but results may become irreproducible, so it is not the default suggestion.\n91:\n92:`--output_base_path` is a path to dir (will be created) to store data for submission preparation and logs.\n93:\n94:`--inference` is important to use this key always. It allows to run on datasets without proper replies provided\n95:(score result 0 will be reported).\n96:\n97:The `--write_out` command turns on extra logging necessary for public submissions. \n98:\n99:`--no_cache` is used to turn off the caching of tokenized inputs and model files (datasets are not cached).\n100:\n(19 more lines below)\n"
