    "The special Jupyter notebook interface consists of a file editor that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.\n",
    "You can execute commands in the notebook using:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bash commands: Commands starting with !.\n",
    "2. Python commands: Standard Python code.\n",
    "3. Magic commands: Commands starting with %, e.g., %cd <path>.\n",

All of the <replacement text> will be entered, so make sure your indentation is formatted properly. Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly.

    "First I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory. Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.\n",
    "```\n",
    "!ls -a\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\n",
    "If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command. \n",
    "You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\n",
