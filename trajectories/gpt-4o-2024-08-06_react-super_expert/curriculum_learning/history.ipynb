There are three types of actions:\\n(1) execute, which executes a notebook cell with the command under the \"content\" field. This could be a bash command (beginning with !), a python command, or magic command (beginning with %).\\n(2) edit, which allows you to replace existing lines in a file with new lines. To replace lines, you will need to provide the lines as they appear before the replacement, and the lines to replace them with.\\nIn the \"content\" field, format should be ```{filename}\\n<<<BEFORE_EDIT>>>\\nlines before edit\\nlines before edit\\n<<<AFTER_EDIT>>>\\nlines after edit\\nlines after edit```\\n  - Include the entire lines WITH indentation.

       "## On Curriculum Learning for Commonsense Reasoning\n\nPyTorch code for the NAACL 2022 paper \"On Curriculum Learning for Commonsense Reasoning\"\n\n\n#### Requirements:\nThis code has been tested on torch==1.9.0 and transformers==4.3.2. Other required packages are [bayes_opt](https://pypi.org/project/bayesian-optimization/) and [tqdm](https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/).\n\n#### Prepare Repository:\nDownload the datasets used in the paper from the following locations:\n[SocialIQA](https://leaderboard.allenai.org/socialiqa/submissions/get-started)\n[CosmosQA](https://leaderboard.allenai.org/cosmosqa/submissions/public)\n[CODAH](https://github.com/yangyiben/G-DAUG-c-Generative-Data-Augmentation-for-Commonsense-Reasoning/tree/master/CODAH)\n[ProtoQA](https://leaderboard.allenai.org/protoqa/submissions/get-started)\n[WinoGrande](https://leaderboard.allenai.org/winogrande/submissions/get-started)\n[GLUE](https://gluebenchmark.com/)\n\nSave to the ```./data/``` folder. Our split of the HellaSWAG-2K dataset is available at the ```./data/hellaswag/``` folder.\n\n#### Training RoBERTa Models for Results in Table 1 in paper:\n\nThe training is performed in two stages. Example commands are shown for the CosmosQA dataset. Scripts for other datasets are available in the repository.\n- Stage 1: In this stage, the teacher models are trained via finetuning of pretrained RoBERTa-Large models using the standard method of randomly sampled training mini-batches. This also serves as the baseline RoBERTa model in our experiments. We provide scripts to find the best hyperparameters for the teacher model using bayesian optimization. To find the best RoBERTa model for CosmosQA, run\\\n```\ncd roberta\npython grid_search_hyperparams_roberta_cosmosqa.py\n```\nThe default location for the model checkpoints is ```./baselines/```. For SocialIQA, CODAH and WinoGrande, we use the best hyperparameters reported in existing literature.\n\n- Ranking of training samples: In this preprocessing step before Stage 2, the predictions from teacher models are used to rank the training samples in the order of difficulty. To get predictions for CosmosQA, run\n```\nbash cosmosqa.sh eval_valid\npython process_logits.py\n```\n\n- Stage 3: In this stage, the student models are trained via curriculum learning using the ranked dataset from the previous step. We use bayesian optimization to find the best parameters for the pacing function; scripts for performing the optimization are available for all datasets in the repository. To find the best pacing function for CosmosQA, run:\n``` \npython search_pacing_function_params_cosmosqa.py\n```\n\n\n## Citation:\n```\n@inproceedings{maharana2022oncurriculum,\n  title={On Curriculum Learning for Commonsense Reasoning},\n  author={Maharana, Adyasha and Bansal, Mohit},\n  booktitle={NAACL},\n  year={2022}\n}\n```\n"
