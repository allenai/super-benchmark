    "[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'Interact in a jupyter notebook to solve the request.\\nOutput a thought and an action.\\nThought can reason about the current situation, and action allows you to interact with the Jupyter notebook. There are three types of actions:\\n(1) execute, which executes a notebook cell with the command under the \"content\" field. This could be a bash command (beginning with !), a python command, or magic command (beginning with %).\\n(2) edit, which allows you to replace existing lines in a file with new lines. To replace lines, you will need to provide the lines as they appear before the replacement, and the lines to replace them with.\\nIn the \"content\" field, format should be ```{filename}\\n<<<BEFORE_EDIT>>>\\nlines before edit\\nlines before edit\\n<<<AFTER_EDIT>>>\\nlines after edit\\nlines after edit```\\n  - Include the entire lines WITH indentation. After editing, make sure indentation is correct.\\n(3) submit, which submits the final answer (or null if there\\'s no answer to submit), formatted as JSON (make sure to use double quotes for keys and values).\\nAlways output exactly one \"thought\" and one \"action\", and encapsulate the content with <content>...</content> tags.\\nI will provide the cell output (observation) for you.\\n\\nTips:\\n- When a github repository is given, you should start by cloning it. You can read the readme file and browse the repo for installation and usage instructions.\\n- Avoid using conda, instead use pip for package management.\\n- Each execution has a 5-minute timeout. After this period, you can decide whether to interrupt the kernel or continue waiting.\\n  You should interrupt if: (1) you are prompted with an interactive message (e.g., \"Do you want to continue? [Y/n]\"). In that case, you can bypass it by executing echo \"y\" | command, or (2) the execution is taking longer than expected because the wrong task is being executed, such as a different model or incorrect number of epochs.\\n  You should continue to wait if the current execution is correct and proceeding as expected.\\n\\nHere are some examples.\\nGit repository: EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness\\nQuery: Evaluate EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B on hellaswag.

SafetyBench also incorporates both Chinese and English data, facilitating the evaluation in both languages. Please visit our [website](https://llmbench.ai/safety) or check our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07045) for more details. \n\n![SafetyBench](./figs/overview.png)\n\n## Table of Contents <!-- omit from toc -->\n- [Leaderboard](#leaderboard)\n- [Data](#data)\n  - [Download](#download)\n  - [Description](#description)\n- [How to Evaluate on SafetyBench](#how-to-evaluate-on-safetybench)\n- [How to Submit](#how-to-submit)\n- [Citation](#citation)\n\n\n## Leaderboard\nThe up-to-date leaderboards are on our [website](https://llmbench.ai/safety). We have three leaderboards for Chinese, English and Chinese subset respectively. We remove questions with highly sensitive keywords and downsample 300 questions for each category to construct the Chinese subset. Summarized evaluation results of some representative LLMs are shown below:\n\n![Result](./figs/res.png)\n\n## Data\n### Download\nWe put our data on the [Hugging Face website](https://huggingface.co/datasets/thu-coai/SafetyBench).\n\nYou can download the test questions and few-shot examples through `wget` directly. Just run the script [`download_data.sh`](./code/download_data.sh)\n\nAlternatively, you can download the test questions and few-shot examples through the `datasets` library. Just run the code [`download_data.py`](./code/download_data.py)\n\n### Description\n`test_zh`, `test_en` ann `test_zh_subset` contain test questions for Chinese, English and Chinese subset respectively. `dev_zh` and `dev_en` contain 5 examples for each safety category, which can be used as few-shot demonstrations. \n\nNote that the `options` field in the data includes at most four items, corresponding to the options A, B, C, D in order. For the `answer` field in the dev data, the mapping rule is: 0->A, 1->B, 2->C, 3->D.\n\n## How to Evaluate on SafetyBench\nIn our paper, we conduct experiments in both zero-shot and five-shot settings. And we extract the predicted answers from models' responses. An example of evaluation code could be found at [code](./code/evaluate_baichuan.py). We don’t include CoT-based evaluation because SafetyBench is less reasoning-intensive than benchmarks testing the model’s\ngeneral capabilities such as MMLU. But feel free to submit your results based on CoT. The default prompt for zero-shot and five-shot evaluation is shown below:\n![figure](./figs/eva_prompts.png)\n\nTo enable more accurate extraction of the predicted answers, we made minor changes to the prompts for some models, which is shown below:\n![figure](./figs/prompt_change.png)\n\n## How to Submit\nYou need to first prepare a UTF-8 encoded JSON file with the following format, please refer to [submission_example.json](./submission_example.json) for details.\n\n```\n## key is the \"id\" field of the test questions\n## value is the predicted answer: 0->A, 1->B, 2->C, 3->D\n{\n    \"0\": 0,\n    \"1\": 1,\n    \"2\": 3,\n    \"3\": 2 \n}\n```\n\nThen you can submit the JSON file to our [website](https://llmbench.ai/safety). \n\n## Citation\n```\n@article{zhang2023safetybench,\n      title={SafetyBench: Evaluating the Safety of Large Language Models with Multiple Choice Questions}, \n      author={Zhexin Zhang and Leqi Lei and Lindong Wu and Rui Sun and Yongkang Huang and Chong Long and Xiao Liu and Xuanyu Lei and Jie Tang and Minlie Huang},\n      journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2309.07045},\n      year={2023}\n}\n```"
