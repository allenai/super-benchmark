    "[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'Interact in a jupyter notebook to solve the request.\\nOutput a thought and an action.\\nThought can reason about the current situation, and action allows you to interact with the Jupyter notebook. There are three types of actions:\\n(1) execute, which executes a notebook cell with the command under the \"content\" field. This could be a bash command (beginning with !), a python command, or magic command (beginning with %).\\n(2) edit, which allows you to replace existing lines in a file with new lines. To replace lines, you will need to provide the lines as they appear before the replacement, and the lines to replace them with.\\nIn the \"content\" field, format should be ```{filename}\\n<<<BEFORE_EDIT>>>\\nlines before edit\\nlines before edit\\n<<<AFTER_EDIT>>>\\nlines after edit\\nlines after edit```\\n  - Include the entire lines WITH indentation. After editing, make sure indentation is correct.\\n(3) submit, which submits the final answer (or null if there\\'s no answer to submit), formatted as JSON (make sure to use double quotes for keys and values).\\nAlways output exactly one \"thought\" and one \"action\", and encapsulate the content with <content>...</content> tags.\\nI will provide the cell output (observation) for you.\\n\\nTips:\\n- When a github repository is given, you should start by cloning it. You can read the readme file and browse the repo for installation and usage instructions.\\n- Avoid using conda, instead use pip for package management.\\n- Each execution has a 5-minute timeout. After this period, you can decide whether to interrupt the kernel or continue waiting.\\n  You should interrupt if: (1) you are prompted with an interactive message (e.g., \"Do you want to continue? [Y/n]\"). In that case, you can bypass it by executing echo \"y\" | command, or (2) the execution is taking longer than expected because the wrong task is being executed, such as a different model or incorrect number of epochs.\\n  You should continue to wait if the current execution is correct and proceeding as expected.\\n\\nHere are some examples.\\nGit repository: EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness\\nQuery: Evaluate EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B on hellaswag.

The core of this work lies in the construction of interventional distributions, from which causal features are identified. See the **quick lead-in** below.\n\n- **Q: What are interventional distributions?**\n  \n  They are basically the distributions when we intervene on one variable or a set of variables in the data generation process. For example, we could intervene on the base graph (highlighted in green or blue), which gives us multiple distributions:\n    <figure> <img src=\"figures/interventional-distributions.png\" height=\"220\"></figure>\n    \n\n- **Q: How to construct the interventional distributions?**    \n    We design the following model structure to do the intervention in the representation space, where the distribution intervener is in charge of sampling one subgraph from the non-causal pool and fixing it at one end of the rationale generator.\n\n    <figure> <img src=\"figures/framework.gif\" height=\"350\"></figure>\n\n\n- **Q: How can these interventional distributions help us approach the causal features for rationalization?**\n    \n    Here is the simple philosophy: *No matter what values we assign to the non-causal part, the class label is invariant as long as we observe the causal part*. \n    Intuitively, interventional distributions offer us \"multiple eyes\" to discover the features that make the label invariant upon interventions. And we propose the DIR objective to achieve this goal\n    <figure> <img src=\"figures/dir-objective.png\" height=\"50\"></figure>\n\n    See our paper for the formal description and the principle behind it. \n\n\n## Installation\n\nNote that **we require `1.7.0 <= torch_geometric <= 2.0.2`**. Simple run the cmd to install the python environment (you may want to change cudatoolkit accordingly based on your cuda version) or see `requirements.txt` for the packages.\n```\nsh setup_env.sh\nconda activate dir\n```\n\n<!-- - Main packages: PyTorch >= 1.5.0, 2.0.2 >= Pytorch Geometric >= 1.7.0, OGB >= 1.3.0. \n- See `requirements.txt` for other packages. -->\n\n## Data download\n- Spurious-Motif: this dataset can be generated via `spmotif_gen/spmotif.ipynb`. \n- [Graph-SST2](https://github.com/divelab/DIG/tree/main/dig/xgraph/datasets): this dataset can be downloaded [here](https://mailustceducn-my.sharepoint.com/personal/yhy12138_mail_ustc_edu_cn/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fyhy12138%5Fmail%5Fustc%5Fedu%5Fcn%2FDocuments%2Fpaper%5Fwork%2FGNN%20Explainability%20Survey%2FSurvey%5FText2graph%2FGraph%2DSST2%2Ezip&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fyhy12138%5Fmail%5Fustc%5Fedu%5Fcn%2FDocuments%2Fpaper%5Fwork%2FGNN%20Explainability%20Survey%2FSurvey%5FText2graph).\n- [MNIST-75sp](https://github.com/bknyaz/graph_attention_pool): this dataset can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Prc-n9Nr8-5z-xphdRScftKKIxU4Olzh). Download `mnist_75sp_train.pkl`, `mnist_75sp_test.pkl`, and `mnist_75sp_color_noise.pt` to the directory `data/MNISTSP/raw/`.\n\n## Run DIR\nThe hyper-parameters used to train the intrinsic interpretable models are set as default in the `argparse.ArgumentParser` in the training files. Feel free to change them if needed. We use separate files to train each dataset.\n\nSimply run `python -m train.{dataset}_dir` to reproduce the results in the paper. \n\n## Common Questions:\n\nHow does the Rationale Generator update its parameters?: https://github.com/Wuyxin/DIR-GNN/issues/7\n\n## Reference \n```\n@inproceedings{\n    wu2022dir,\n    title={Discovering Invariant Rationales for Graph Neural Networks},\n    author={Ying-Xin Wu and Xiang Wang and An Zhang and Xiangnan He and Tat-seng Chua},\n    booktitle={ICLR},\n    year={2022},\n}\n```\n"
