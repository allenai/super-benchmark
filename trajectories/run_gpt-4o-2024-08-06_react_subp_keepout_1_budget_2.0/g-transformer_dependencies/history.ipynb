    "[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'Interact in a jupyter notebook to solve the request.\\nOutput a thought and an action.\\nThought can reason about the current situation, and action allows you to interact with the Jupyter notebook. There are three types of actions:\\n(1) execute, which executes a notebook cell with the command under the \"content\" field. This could be a bash command (beginning with !), a python command, or magic command (beginning with %).\\n(2) edit, which allows you to replace existing lines in a file with new lines. To replace lines, you will need to provide the lines as they appear before the replacement, and the lines to replace them with.\\nIn the \"content\" field, format should be ```{filename}\\n<<<BEFORE_EDIT>>>\\nlines before edit\\nlines before edit\\n<<<AFTER_EDIT>>>\\nlines after edit\\nlines after edit```\\n  - Include the entire lines WITH indentation. After editing, make sure indentation is correct.\\n(3) submit, which submits the final answer (or null if there\\'s no answer to submit), formatted as JSON (make sure to use double quotes for keys and values).\\nAlways output exactly one \"thought\" and one \"action\", and encapsulate the content with <content>...</content> tags.\\nI will provide the cell output (observation) for you.\\n\\nTips:\\n- When a github repository is given, you should start by cloning it. You can read the readme file and browse the repo for installation and usage instructions.\\n- Avoid using conda, instead use pip for package management.\\n- Each execution has a 5-minute timeout. After this period, you can decide whether to interrupt the kernel or continue waiting.\\n  You should interrupt if: (1) you are prompted with an interactive message (e.g., \"Do you want to continue? [Y/n]\"). In that case, you can bypass it by executing echo \"y\" | command, or (2) the execution is taking longer than expected because the wrong task is being executed, such as a different model or incorrect number of epochs.\\n  You should continue to wait if the current execution is correct and proceeding as expected.\\n\\nHere are some examples.\\nGit repository: EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness\\nQuery: Evaluate EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B on hellaswag.

We use a [snapshot version]( https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UJmZn9LXPvOoifVKblt0RhUFsZRusOrt/view?usp=sharing ) between 0.9.0 and 1.10.0 as our initial code.\n\n\nBefore running the scripts, please install fairseq dependencies by:\n```\n    pip install --editable .\n```\nPlease also follow the readmes under folder raw_data and mbart.cc25 to download raw data and pretrained model.\n(Notes: Our models were trained on 4 GPUs. If you trained them on 2 GPUs, in theory you could double the number for argument --update-freq. However, we haven't tested such settings.)\n\n## Non-pretraining Settings\n\n### G-Transformer random initialized\n* Prepare data: \n```\n    mkdir exp_randinit\n    bash exp_gtrans/run-all.sh prepare-randinit exp_randinit\n```\n\n* Train model:\n```\n    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 bash exp_gtrans/run-all.sh run-randinit train exp_randinit\n```\n\n* Evaluate model:\n```\n    bash exp_gtrans/run-all.sh run-randinit test exp_randinit\n```\n\n### G-Transformer fine-tuned on sent Transformer\n* Prepare data: \n```\n    mkdir exp_finetune\n    bash exp_gtrans/run-all.sh prepare-finetune exp_finetune\n```\n\n* Train model:\n```\n    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 bash exp_gtrans/run-all.sh run-finetune train exp_finetune\n```\n\n* Evaluate model:\n```\n    bash exp_gtrans/run-all.sh run-finetune test exp_finetune\n```\n\n## Pretraining Settings\n### G-Transformer fine-tuned on mBART25\n* Prepare data: \n```\n    mkdir exp_mbart\n    bash exp_gtrans/run-all.sh prepare-mbart exp_mbart\n```\n\n* Train model:\n```\n    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 bash exp_gtrans/run-all.sh run-mbart train exp_mbart\n```\n\n* Evaluate model:\n```\n    bash exp_gtrans/run-all.sh run-mbart test exp_mbart\n```\n"
