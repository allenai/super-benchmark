The core of this work lies in the construction of interventional distributions, from which causal features are identified. See the **quick lead-in** below.\n16:\n17:- **Q: What are interventional distributions?**\n18:  \n19:  They are basically the distributions when we intervene on one variable or a set of variables in the data generation process. For example, we could intervene on the base graph (highlighted in green or blue), which gives us multiple distributions:\n20:    <figure> <img src=\"figures/interventional-distributions.png\" height=\"220\"></figure>\n21:    \n22:\n23:- **Q: How to construct the interventional distributions?**    \n24:    We design the following model structure to do the intervention in the representation space, where the distribution intervener is in charge of sampling one subgraph from the non-causal pool and fixing it at one end of the rationale generator.\n25:\n26:    <figure> <img src=\"figures/framework.gif\" height=\"350\"></figure>\n27:\n28:\n29:- **Q: How can these interventional distributions help us approach the causal features for rationalization?**\n30:    \n31:    Here is the simple philosophy: *No matter what values we assign to the non-causal part, the class label is invariant as long as we observe the causal part*. \n32:    Intuitively, interventional distributions offer us \"multiple eyes\" to discover the features that make the label invariant upon interventions. And we propose the DIR objective to achieve this goal\n33:    <figure> <img src=\"figures/dir-objective.png\" height=\"50\"></figure>\n34:\n35:    See our paper for the formal description and the principle behind it. \n36:\n37:\n38:## Installation\n39:\n40:Note that **we require `1.7.0 <= torch_geometric <= 2.0.2`**. Simple run the cmd to install the python environment (you may want to change cudatoolkit accordingly based on your cuda version) or see `requirements.txt` for the packages.\n41:```\n42:sh setup_env.sh\n43:conda activate dir\n44:```\n45:\n46:<!-- - Main packages: PyTorch >= 1.5.0, 2.0.2 >= Pytorch Geometric >= 1.7.0, OGB >= 1.3.0. \n47:- See `requirements.txt` for other packages. -->\n48:\n49:## Data download\n50:- Spurious-Motif: this dataset can be generated via `spmotif_gen/spmotif.ipynb`. \n51:- [Graph-SST2](https://github.com/divelab/DIG/tree/main/dig/xgraph/datasets): this dataset can be downloaded [here](https://mailustceducn-my.sharepoint.com/personal/yhy12138_mail_ustc_edu_cn/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fyhy12138%5Fmail%5Fustc%5Fedu%5Fcn%2FDocuments%2Fpaper%5Fwork%2FGNN%20Explainability%20Survey%2FSurvey%5FText2graph%2FGraph%2DSST2%2Ezip&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fyhy12138%5Fmail%5Fustc%5Fedu%5Fcn%2FDocuments%2Fpaper%5Fwork%2FGNN%20Explainability%20Survey%2FSurvey%5FText2graph).\n52:- [MNIST-75sp](https://github.com/bknyaz/graph_attention_pool): this dataset can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Prc-n9Nr8-5z-xphdRScftKKIxU4Olzh).

The core of this work lies in the construction of interventional distributions, from which causal features are identified. See the **quick lead-in** below.\n16:\n17:- **Q: What are interventional distributions?**\n18:  \n19:  They are basically the distributions when we intervene on one variable or a set of variables in the data generation process. For example, we could intervene on the base graph (highlighted in green or blue), which gives us multiple distributions:\n20:    <figure> <img src=\"figures/interventional-distributions.png\" height=\"220\"></figure>\n21:    \n22:\n23:- **Q: How to construct the interventional distributions?**    \n24:    We design the following model structure to do the intervention in the representation space, where the distribution intervener is in charge of sampling one subgraph from the non-causal pool and fixing it at one end of the rationale generator.\n25:\n26:    <figure> <img src=\"figures/framework.gif\" height=\"350\"></figure>\n27:\n28:\n29:- **Q: How can these interventional distributions help us approach the causal features for rationalization?**\n30:    \n31:    Here is the simple philosophy: *No matter what values we assign to the non-causal part, the class label is invariant as long as we observe the causal part*. \n32:    Intuitively, interventional distributions offer us \"multiple eyes\" to discover the features that make the label invariant upon interventions. And we propose the DIR objective to achieve this goal\n33:    <figure> <img src=\"figures/dir-objective.png\" height=\"50\"></figure>\n34:\n35:    See our paper for the formal description and the principle behind it. \n36:\n37:\n38:## Installation\n39:\n40:Note that **we require `1.7.0 <= torch_geometric <= 2.0.2`**. Simple run the cmd to install the python environment (you may want to change cudatoolkit accordingly based on your cuda version) or see `requirements.txt` for the packages.\n41:```\n42:sh setup_env.sh\n43:conda activate dir\n44:```\n45:\n46:<!-- - Main packages: PyTorch >= 1.5.0, 2.0.2 >= Pytorch Geometric >= 1.7.0, OGB >= 1.3.0. \n47:- See `requirements.txt` for other packages. -->\n48:\n49:## Data download\n50:- Spurious-Motif: this dataset can be generated via `spmotif_gen/spmotif.ipynb`. \n51:- [Graph-SST2](https://github.com/divelab/DIG/tree/main/dig/xgraph/datasets): this dataset can be downloaded [here](https://mailustceducn-my.sharepoint.com/personal/yhy12138_mail_ustc_edu_cn/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fyhy12138%5Fmail%5Fustc%5Fedu%5Fcn%2FDocuments%2Fpaper%5Fwork%2FGNN%20Explainability%20Survey%2FSurvey%5FText2graph%2FGraph%2DSST2%2Ezip&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fyhy12138%5Fmail%5Fustc%5Fedu%5Fcn%2FDocuments%2Fpaper%5Fwork%2FGNN%20Explainability%20Survey%2FSurvey%5FText2graph).\n52:- [MNIST-75sp](https://github.com/bknyaz/graph_attention_pool): this dataset can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Prc-n9Nr8-5z-xphdRScftKKIxU4Olzh).

Feel free to change them if needed. We use separate files to train each dataset.\n56:\n57:Simply run `python -m train.{dataset}_dir` to reproduce the results in the paper. \n58:\n59:## Common Questions:\n60:\n61:How does the Rationale Generator update its parameters?: https://github.com/Wuyxin/DIR-GNN/issues/7\n62:\n63:## Reference \n64:```\n65:@inproceedings{\n66:    wu2022dir,\n67:    title={Discovering Invariant Rationales for Graph Neural Networks},\n68:    author={Ying-Xin Wu and Xiang Wang and An Zhang and Xiangnan He and Tat-seng Chua},\n69:    booktitle={ICLR},\n70:    year={2022},\n71:}\n72:```\n"
