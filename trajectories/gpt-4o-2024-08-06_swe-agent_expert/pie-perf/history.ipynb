Next, we need to provide the path to the file with some metadata. We call it the `reference_file` but providing references are optional. The main purpose of this file is to provide information like the language of the code, the problem id, etc. The file should have `slow_code_col` (same as the generations file) and `problem_id`. We join the generations file and the references file on the `slow_code_col` to get the problem id.\n(51 more lines below)\n"
