       "[File: /content/galore/README.md (169 lines total)]\n1:# GaLore\n2:\n3:This repo contains the pre-release version of GaLore algorithm, proposed by [GaLore: Memory-Efficient LLM Training by Gradient Low-Rank Projection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03507).\n4:\n5:Gradient Low-Rank Projection (GaLore) is a memory-efficient low-rank training strategy that allows *full-parameter* learning but is more *memory-efficient* than common low-rank adaptation methods, such as LoRA.\n6:As a gradient projection method, GaLore is independent of the choice of optimizers and can be easily plugged into existing ones with only two lines of code, as shown in Algorithm 1 below.\n7:\n8:<div align=\"center\">\n9:  <img src=\"imgs/galore_code_box.png\" alt=\"Image 2\" style=\"width: 550px; margin: 0 auto;\">\n10:</div>\n11:\n12:## News\n13:Thanks everyone for your interest in GaLore! \n14:\n15:**We are working on the official release of GaLore.** In the meantime, please feel free to try the pre-release version and provide feedback to us. Currently, the pre-release version (e.g., GaLore optimizers) should provide a decent memory reduction and accurate simulation of GaLore algorithm. \n16:\n17:The official release of GaLore will include:\n18:\n19:1. Per-layer weight updates for multi-GPU training (DDP and FSDP) (working with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)).\n20:2. Memory-efficient low-rank gradient accumulation (working with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)).\n21:3. Optimized `GaLoreAdamW8bit` (working with [bitsandbytes](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes)).\n22:\n23:We would like to express our gratitude to the community members who have been actively working on integrating GaLore into different platforms, including [HuggingFace](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/29588), [LLaMA-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory), and [Axolotl](https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl/pull/1370). Join our Slack workspace [GaLore-Social](https://join.slack.com/t/galore-social/shared_invite/zt-2ev152px0-DguuQ5WRTLQjtq2C88HBvQ) to engage in discussions with us.\n24:\n25:## Discussion [(GaLore-Social)](https://join.slack.com/t/galore-social/shared_invite/zt-2ev152px0-DguuQ5WRTLQjtq2C88HBvQ)\n26:\n27:We welcome any discussions, questions, and feedback on GaLore. Please join our Slack workspace [GaLore-Social](https://join.slack.com/t/galore-social/shared_invite/zt-2ev152px0-DguuQ5WRTLQjtq2C88HBvQ) to discuss with us and the community.\n28:\n29:\n30:## Installation\n31:\n32:### Install GaLore optimizer\n33:Install from pip:\n34:```bash \n35:pip install galore-torch\n36:```\n37:\n38:or if you want to install from source:\n39:\n40:```bash\n41:git clone git@github.com:jiaweizzhao/GaLore.git\n42:cd GaLore\n43:pip install -e .\n44:```\n45:\n46:### Install experiment dependencies\n47:\n48:```bash\n49:pip install -r exp_requirements.txt\n50:```\n51:\n52:Our experiment scripts are tested on Python 3.8 with PyTorch 2.1.\n53:\n54:## Usage\n55:\n56:### Save optimizer memory using GaLore optimizers\n57:\n58:```python\n59:from galore_torch import GaLoreAdamW, GaLoreAdamW8bit, GaLoreAdafactor\n60:# define param groups as galore_params and non_galore_params\n61:param_groups = [{'params': non_galore_params}, \n62:                {'params': galore_params, 'rank': 128, 'update_proj_gap': 200, 'scale': 0.25, 'proj_type': 'std'}]\n63:optimizer = GaLoreAdamW(param_groups, lr=0.01)\n64:```\n65:### Save weight gradient memory using per-layer weight updates\n66:\n67:We use `register_post_accumulate_grad_hook` provided by [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/optimizer_step_in_backward_tutorial.html) (`torch>=2.1.0`) to enable per-layer weight updates. An example is shown below:\n68:\n69:```python\n70:# define an optimizer for each parameter p, and store them in optimizer_dict\n71:for p in model.parameters():\n72:    if p.requires_grad:\n73:        optimizer_dict[p] = GaLoreAdamW([{'params': p, 'rank': 128, 'update_proj_gap': 200, 'scale': 0.25, 'proj_type': 'std'}], lr=0.01)\n74:\n75:# define a hook function to update the parameter p during the backward pass\n76:def optimizer_hook(p):\n77:    if p.grad is None: \n78:        return\n79:    optimizer_dict[p].step()\n80:    optimizer_dict[p].zero_grad()\n81:\n82:# Register the hook onto every parameter\n83:for p in model.parameters():\n84:    if p.requires_grad:\n85:        p.register_post_accumulate_grad_hook(optimizer_hook)\n86:```\n87:More details can be found in [torchrun_main.py](https://github.com/jiaweizzhao/GaLore/blob/a6bc1650984b1c090a4e108d7c0e3109ee7ad844/torchrun_main.py#L334).\n88:\n89:## Benchmark 1: Pre-Training LLaMA on C4 dataset\n90:`torchrun_main.py` is the main script for training LLaMA models on C4 with GaLore. Our benchmark scripts for various sizes of models are in `scripts/benchmark_c4` folder.\n91:For example, to train a 60m model on C4, do the following:\n92:\n93:```bash\n94:# LLaMA-60M, GaLore-Adam, 1 A100, 1 Node\n95:torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node 1 torchrun_main.py \\\n96:    --model_config configs/llama_60m.json \\\n97:    --lr 0.01 \\\n98:    --galore_scale 0.25 \\\n99:    --rank 128 \\\n100:    --update_proj_gap 200 \\\n(69 more lines below)\n"
