    "[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'Interact in a jupyter notebook to solve the request.\\nOutput a thought and an action.\\nThought can reason about the current situation, and action allows you to interact with the Jupyter notebook. There are three types of actions:\\n(1) execute, which executes a notebook cell with the command under the \"content\" field. This could be a bash command (beginning with !), a python command, or magic command (beginning with %).\\n(2) edit, which allows you to replace existing lines in a file with new lines. To replace lines, you will need to provide the lines as they appear before the replacement, and the lines to replace them with.\\nIn the \"content\" field, format should be ```{filename}\\n<<<BEFORE_EDIT>>>\\nlines before edit\\nlines before edit\\n<<<AFTER_EDIT>>>\\nlines after edit\\nlines after edit```\\n  - Include the entire lines WITH indentation. After editing, make sure indentation is correct.\\n(3) submit, which submits the final answer (or null if there\\'s no answer to submit), formatted as JSON (make sure to use double quotes for keys and values).\\nAlways output exactly one \"thought\" and one \"action\", and encapsulate the content with <content>...</content> tags.\\nI will provide the cell output (observation) for you.\\n\\nTips:\\n- When a github repository is given, you should start by cloning it. You can read the readme file and browse the repo for installation and usage instructions.\\n- Avoid using conda, instead use pip for package management.\\n- Each execution has a 5-minute timeout. After this period, you can decide whether to interrupt the kernel or continue waiting.\\n  You should interrupt if: (1) you are prompted with an interactive message (e.g., \"Do you want to continue? [Y/n]\"). In that case, you can bypass it by executing echo \"y\" | command, or (2) the execution is taking longer than expected because the wrong task is being executed, such as a different model or incorrect number of epochs.\\n  You should continue to wait if the current execution is correct and proceeding as expected.\\n\\nHere are some examples.\\nGit repository: EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness\\nQuery: Evaluate EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B on hellaswag.

       "**[News] InBedder is accepted to the Main Conference of ACL2024!🎇**\n\n<img src=\"images/InBedder.jpeg\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\">\n\n<span style=\"font-size:10px;\">Credit DALL·E 3</span>\n\n# 🛌InBedder: Instruction-following Text Embedder\n\nThis repository contains the code, dataset and pre-trained models for our paper [Answer is All You Need: Instruction-following Text Embedding via Answering the Question](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09642).\n\nWe introduce 🛌**InBedder**, a text embedder that is designed to follow instructions. Instruction-following text embedder can capture characteristics of texts specified by user instructions. InBedder offers a novel viewpoint that treats the instruction as a _question_ about the input text and encodes the _expected answers_ to obtain the representation accordingly. We show that InBedder is aware of instructions with different evaluation tasks.\n\n**************************** **Updates** ****************************\n\n* 02/15/2024: We released [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09642), [code](https://github.com/zhang-yu-wei/InBedder/), [pre-training dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/KomeijiForce/Inbedder-Pretrain-Data), [evaluation dataset](https://huggingface.co/BrandonZYW), [project page]() and [checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/BrandonZYW). Check them out!\n\n## ⚡ Quick Start\nYou can check the code in [UseCase.ipynb](https://github.com/zhang-yu-wei/InBedder/blob/main/UseCase.ipynb) for a quick trial for our model!\n\n## 📦 Installation\nFollow the following steps to set up InBedder.\n```bash\nconda create -n inbedder python=3.9\nconda activate inbedder\npython -m pip install torch==2.1.0 torchvision==0.16.0 torchaudio==2.1.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118\npython -m pip install -r requirements.txt\npython -m pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation\n```\n\n## 🚀 Getting Started\n\n### Load Model\n\n```python\nfrom lm_encoders_hf import CausalLMEncoder, MaskedLMEncoder\n\nmodel = CausalLMEncoder(\n    model_name_or_path=\"BrandonZYW/llama-2-7b-InBedder\",\n    temperature=0.6,\n    top_p=0.9,\n    max_new_tokens=3,\n    do_sample=True\n)\nmodel = MaskedLMEncoder(\n    model_name_or_path=\"BrandonZYW/roberta-large-InBedder\",\n    mask_length=3\n)\n```\n\nRemember to set your output value to last layer, for example\n```python\nmodel.set_output_value(\"fst_gen_layer_32\")\n```\n\nCheckout `demos` for more example usage.\n\n### Add instructions\n\n```python\npattern = \"### Input:\\n{input}\\n\\n### Instruction:\\n{instruction}\\n\\n### Response:\"\ncorpus = [pattern.replace('{input}', s).replace('{instruction}', instruction) for s in corpus]\n```\n\n### The `encode` function\n\n```python\nembeddings, generations = model.encode(\n    corpus,\n    batch_size=32,\n    cache_dir=None, # useful when you want to reuse the embeddings\n    return_generations=True # useful if you want to look at your generations\n)\n```\n\n## 📊 Model List\n\nWe released a series of InBedder checkpoints with different sizes. You can easily load these models with huggingface. \n|              Model              | Avg. Score |\n|:-------------------------------|:--------:|\n| [llama-2-7b-InBedder](https://huggingface.co/BrandonZYW/llama-2-7b-InBedder) | **58.80** |\n| [opt-2.7b-InBedder](https://huggingface.co/BrandonZYW/opt-2.7b-InBedder)   | 56.57 |\n| [opt-1.3b-InBedder](https://huggingface.co/BrandonZYW/opt-1.3b-InBedder)   | 54.99 |\n| [roberta-large-InBedder](https://huggingface.co/BrandonZYW/roberta-large-InBedder)   | 53.06 |\n\n## 💡 Use Case\nWe show how to use InBedder for personalized clustering in `propose.py`. Execute it by running\n```bash\nbash scripts/propose.sh\n```\nAdditionally, `analyze_propose_results.py` and `gather_cluster_results.py` will help you get the top-words from each cluster and compare with label components.\n\n## 🏋️‍♂️ Training\n### Data\n\nPlease checkout our training dataset [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/KomeijiForce/Inbedder-Pretrain-Data).\n\n### Train InBedder\n\nWe follow [stanford_alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca/tree/main) for training.\n```bash\ncd alpaca_train\nbash scripts/train.sh # this is for roberta-large, opt-1.3b\nbash scripts/train_2.7b.sh # this is for opt-2.7b\nbash scripts/train_7b.sh # this is for llama\n```\n\n## ✅ Evaluation\n### Data\n\nTo facilitate future research, we are happy to release evaluation data we used/created.\n\n- [IntentEmotion](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BrandonZYW/IntentEmotion)\n- [InstructSTSB](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BrandonZYW/InstructSTSB)\n- [NYTClustering](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BrandonZYW/NYTClustering)\n- [RateMyProfClustering](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BrandonZYW/RateMyProfClustering)\n- [FeedbacksClustering](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BrandonZYW/FeedbacksClustering)\n- [FewRelClustering](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BrandonZYW/FewRelClustering)\n- [FewNerdClustering](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BrandonZYW/FewNerdClustering)\n- [FewEventClustering](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BrandonZYW/FewEventClustering)\n\n### Evaluation Code\n\nThe evaluation code is contained in `evaluation.py`. To execute evaluation and reproduce results in the paper, use `scripts/evaluation.sh`. Simply select one line to uncomment and fill in the cuda device id, and then run\n```bash\nbash scripts/evaluation.sh\n```\nNotice that you can check all available configs in `configs` folder. Additionally, if you want to evaluate with the instruction robustness tests, there is a section named \"robustness\" that can execute them.\n\n## 🐞 Bugs or questions?\nIf you have any questions related to the code or the paper, feel free to email Yuwei (`yuz163@ucsd.edu`) and Letian (`lepeng@ucsd.edu`).\n\n## 📑 Citation\nIf you find our work helpful, please cite us:\n\n```bibtex\n@article{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2402.09642,\n  author       = {Letian Peng and\n                  Yuwei Zhang and\n                  Zilong Wang and\n                  Jayanth Srinivasa and\n                  Gaowen Liu and\n                  Zihan Wang and\n                  Jingbo Shang},\n  title        = {Answer is All You Need: Instruction-following Text Embedding via Answering the Question},\n  journal      = {CoRR},\n  volume       = {abs/2402.09642},\n  year         = {2023},\n  url          = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09642},\n  eprinttype    = {arXiv},\n  eprint       = {2402.09642},\n  biburl       = {https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2402.09642.bib},\n  bibsource    = {dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org}\n}\n```\n\n## 📚 References\n- [instructor-embedding](https://github.com/xlang-ai/instructor-embedding)\n- [stanford_alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca/tree/main)\n- [mteb](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb)\n"

I also heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it ever tried to enter this country, therefore being a fan of films considered \"controversial\" I really had to see this for myself.<br /><br />The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.<br /><br />What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it\\'s not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.<br /><br />I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes (no pun intended) of Swedish cinema. But really, this film doesn\\'t have much of a plot.', 'label': 0}\n"
