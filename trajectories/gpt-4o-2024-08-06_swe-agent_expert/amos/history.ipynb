The two code versions are mostly equivalent in functionality, and you are free to use either of them. However, we note that the [fairseq](fairseq) version is what we used in our experiments, and it will best reproduce the results in the paper; the [huggingface](huggingface) version is implemented later to provide compatibility with the Huggingface Transformers Library, and may yield slightly different results.\n12:\n13:Please follow the README files under the two directories for running the code.\n14:\n15:## GLUE Fine-Tuning Results\n16:\n17:The [General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE)](https://gluebenchmark.com/) benchmark is a collection of sentence- or sentence-pair language understanding tasks for evaluating and analyzing natural language understanding systems. \n18:\n19:GLUE dev set results of AMOS base++ model are as follows (median of 5 different random seeds):\n20:\n21:| Model | MNLI-m/mm | QQP | QNLI | SST-2 | CoLA | RTE | MRPC | STS-B | AVG |\n22:| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n23:| AMOS base++ | 90.5/90.4 | 92.4 | 94.4 | 95.5 | 71.8 | 86.6 | 91.7 | 92.0 | 89.4 |\n24:\n25:GLUE test set results of AMOS base++ model are as follows (no ensemble, task-specific tricks, etc.):\n26:\n27:| Model | MNLI-m/mm | QQP | QNLI | SST-2 | CoLA | RTE | MRPC | STS-B | AVG |\n28:| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n29:| AMOS base++ | 90.4/89.9 | 90.2 | 94.6 | 96.8 | 69.2 | 83.6 | 88.9 | 91.3 | 88.1 |\n30:\n31:## SQuAD 2.0 Fine-Tuning Results\n32:\n33:[Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD)](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) is a reading comprehension dataset, consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage, or the question might be unanswerable. \n34:\n35:SQuAD 2.0 dev set results of AMOS base++ and large++ models are as follows (median of 5 different random seeds):\n36:\n37:| Model | EM | F1 |\n38:| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n39:| AMOS base++ | 85.0 | 87.9 |\n40:\n41:## Citation\n42:If you find the code and models useful for your research, please cite the following paper:\n43:```\n44:@inproceedings{meng2022amos,\n45:  title={Pretraining Text Encoders with Adversarial Mixture of Training Signal Generators},\n46:  author={Meng, Yu and Xiong, Chenyan and Bajaj, Payal and Tiwary, Saurabh and Bennett, Paul and Han, Jiawei and Song, Xia},\n47:  booktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\n48:  year={2022}\n49:}\n50:```\n51:\n52:## Contributing\n53:\n54:This project welcomes contributions and suggestions.

       "[File: /content/amos/fairseq/README.md (96 lines total)]\n1:# AMOS (Fairseq)\n2:\n3:This directory contains the Fairseq version of scripts for fine-tuning AMOS pretrained models on GLUE and SQuAD benchmarks. The scripts are based on the [Fairseq Library](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq).\n4:\n5:Paper: [Pretraining Text Encoders with Adversarial Mixture of Training Signal Generators](https://openreview.net/forum?id=sX3XaHwotOg)\n6:\n7:## Requirements\n8:\n9:The scripts require Python 3.6+ and Pytorch 1.5.0+. In addition, you need to install the codebase by running:\n10:```\n11:bash install.sh\n12:```\n13:\n14:## Pretrained Models\n15:\n16:We release one [AMOS pretrained model](https://github.com/microsoft/AMOS/releases/download/v0.1.0/amos.tar.gz) (**Note: Please follow the links here to download it; do not use the huggingface version of pretrained models as they are not compatible with Fairseq**), which corresponds to the `base++` model mentioned in the paper. You need to extract the models from the archives.\n17:\n18:## GLUE Fine-tuning\n19:\n20:The [General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE)](https://gluebenchmark.com/) benchmark is a collection of sentence- or sentence-pair language understanding tasks for evaluating and analyzing natural language understanding systems. \n21:\n22:**Download GLUE Data**: You can download the [GLUE data](https://gluebenchmark.com/tasks) by running [this script](https://gist.github.com/W4ngatang/60c2bdb54d156a41194446737ce03e2e) and unpack it to some directory.\n23:\n24:**Process GLUE Data**: Since Fairseq training takes binary input files, you need to first preprocess the GLUE data to generate binary files by running the following:\n25:```\n26:cd preprocess/glue\n27:bash process.sh <glue_data_folder> <task_name> <dict_dir> <output>\n28:```\n29:where `<glue_data_folder>` is the path of the raw GLUE data; `<task_name>` is one of the following: `{ALL, QQP, MNLI, QNLI, MRPC, RTE, STS-B, SST-2, CoLA}`; use `ALL` for preprocessing all the GLUE tasks; `<dict_dir>` is the directory containing two dictionary files `sp.model` and `dict.txt` which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/microsoft/AMOS/releases/download/v0.1.0/dict.tar.gz); `<task_name>` is the output directory for processed GLUE data.\n30:\n31:**Fine-Tuning**: After preprocessing the GLUE data, you can run the [`run_glue.sh`](run_glue.sh) script for fine-tuning on each GLUE task. An example for using the script for fine-tuning on MNLI is shown below:\n32:```\n33:TASK=MNLI\n34:PRETRAINED_MODEL_PATH=/path/to/amos/model.pt\n35:GLUE_DATA_DIR=/path/to/processed/glue_data\n36:OUT_PATH=./glue_finetune/amos\n37:BSZ=32\n38:LR=2e-5\n39:EPOCH=2\n40:WARMUP=16\n41:SEED=1\n42:\n43:export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0\n44:bash run_glue.sh $TASK $PRETRAINED_MODEL_PATH $GLUE_DATA_DIR $OUT_PATH $EPOCH $WARMUP $BSZ $LR $SEED\n45:```\n46:**Note: The `WARMUP` argument is the reciprocal of the warmup ratio (e.g., `WARMUP=16` means that we are using a 6.25% warmup ratio)**\n47:\n48:**Optimal Hyperparameters**: The fine-tuning hyperparameters leading to the best dev set performance in our experiments are shown below (please note that the results and optimal hyperparameters might slightly differ in your runs due to different computation environments):\n49:\n50:* AMOS base++\n51:\n52:|  | MNLI-m/mm | QQP | QNLI | SST-2 | CoLA | RTE | MRPC | STS-B |\n53:| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n54:| BSZ | 32/32 | 32 | 32 | 32 | 32 | 32 | 32 | 16 |\n55:| LR | 1e-5/1e-5 | 2e-5 | 2e-5 | 1e-5 | 2e-5 | 4e-5 | 4e-5 | 4e-5 |\n56:| EPOCH | 3/2 | 5 | 3 | 5 | 10 | 5 | 10 | 10 |\n57:| WARMUP | 16/16 | 16 | 16 | 16 | 10 | 10 | 16 | 16 |\n58:| Result | 90.5/90.4 | 92.3 | 94.5 | 95.6 | 71.8 | 87.4 | 91.4 | 92.0 |\n59:\n60:## SQuAD 2.0 Fine-tuning \n61:[Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD)](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) is a reading comprehension dataset, consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage, or the question might be unanswerable. \n62:\n63:**Download & Process SQuAD Data**: Since Fairseq training takes binary input files, you need to first preprocess the SQuAD data to generate pickle files by running the following (SQuAD raw data will be automatically downloaded):\n64:```\n65:cd preprocess/squad\n66:bash process.sh <squad_data_folder> <dict_dir>\n67:```\n68:where `<squad_data_folder>` is the path where raw and processed SQuAD data will be stored to; `<dict_dir>` is the directory containing two dictionary files `sp.model` and `dict.txt` which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/microsoft/AMOS/releases/download/v0.1.0/dict.tar.gz).\n69:\n70:**Fine-Tuning**: After preprocessing the SQuAD data, you can run the [`run_squad.sh`](run_squad.sh) script for fine-tuning on SQuAD 2.0. An example for using the script is shown below:\n71:```\n72:PRETRAINED_MODEL_PATH=/path/to/amos/model.pt\n73:DATA_DIR=/path/to/processed/squad2_data\n74:OUT_PATH=./squad2_finetune/amos\n75:BSZ=16\n76:LR=2e-5\n77:EPOCH=3\n78:WARMUP=10\n79:SEED=1\n80:\n81:export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0\n82:bash run_squad.sh $PRETRAINED_MODEL_PATH $DATA_DIR $OUT_PATH $EPOCH $WARMUP $BSZ $LR $SEED\n83:```\n84:**Note: The `WARMUP` argument is the reciprocal of the warmup ratio (e.g., `WARMUP=16` means that we are using a 6.25% warmup ratio)**\n85:\n86:**Optimal Hyperparameters**: The fine-tuning hyperparameters leading to the best dev set performance in our experiments are shown below (please note that the results and optimal hyperparameters might slightly differ in your runs due to different computation environments):\n87:\n88:* AMOS base++\n89:\n90:|  | EM | F1 |\n91:| ------ | ------ | ------ |\n92:| BSZ | 16 | 16 |\n93:| LR | 2e-5 | 2e-5 |\n94:| EPOCH | 3 | 3 |\n95:| WARMUP | 16 | 10 |\n96:| Result | 85.0 | 87.9 |\n"
