Binary Classification as an Effective Approach to Multi-Choice Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16495) (EMNLP 2022)\n4:\n5:## Experiments\n6:\n7:We have created separate training scripts for each of the datasets.\n8:\n9:For example, the DeBERTa TEAM model on the SWAG dataset can be trained as follows:\n10:\n11:```\n12:CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train_swag.py --name \"microsoft/deberta-v3-large\" --epochs 5 --lr 1e-6 --shuffle\n13:```\n14:\n15:You can use `--name \"roberta-large\"` to train the RoBERTa model.\n16:\n17:You can use the appropriate training scripts for the other datasets. Running the scripts will print an `Instance Acc`, which is the main MCQA task accuracy reported in the Table 2 and 3 of our paper. For some of the datasets, you need to upload the test predictions in the [AllenAI Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.allenai.org/) to obtain the test results. The scripts provided in this repository will save the test predictions for each epoch in the appropriate experiment folders ready for upload to the leaderboard.\n18:\n19:\n20:The Score models can be benchmarked using the `run_mcqa_score.py` script. The scirpt is adapted from the [HuggingFace MCQA example](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/pytorch/multiple-choice).\n21:\n22:The DeBERTa Score model on the SWAG dataset can be trained as follows:\n23:```\n24:CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3 python run_mcqa_score.py --learning_rate=1e-6 --num_train_epochs 5 --seed 42 \\\n25:--train_file=\"data/swag/mcq_train.json\" --validation_file=\"data/swag/mcq_val.json\" --test_file=\"data/swag/mcq_test.json\" \\\n26:--output_dir=\"saved/swag/mcq/deberta-large\" --model_name_or_path=\"microsoft/deberta-v3-large\" \\\n27:--per_device_train_batch_size=8 --per_device_eval_batch_size=8 --weight_decay=0.005 \\\n28:--do_train True --do_eval True --do_predict True --evaluation_strategy=\"epoch\" --save_strategy=\"epoch\" \\\n29:--report_to \"wandb\" --run_name \"DEBERTA SWAG MCQ\" --save_total_limit=1 --overwrite_output_dir\n30:```\n31:\n32:Change the `--train_file, --validation_file, --test_file` arguments to train and evaluate on the other datasets. Change the `--model_name_or_path` to train other models for the task.\n33:\n34:## Citation\n35:\n36:Please cite the following paper if you find this code useful in your work.\n37:\n38:```\n39:Two is Better than Many?
