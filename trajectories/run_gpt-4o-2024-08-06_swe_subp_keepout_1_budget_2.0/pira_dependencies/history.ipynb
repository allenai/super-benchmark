    "```\n",
    "!ls -a\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\n",
    "If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command. \n",
    "You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\n",
