Specifically, it was pretrained by feeding linked documents into the same language model context, besides using a single document as in BERT.\n14:\n15:LinkBERT can be used as a drop-in replacement for BERT. It achieves better performance for general language understanding tasks (e.g. text classification), and is also particularly effective for **knowledge-intensive** tasks (e.g. question answering) and **cross-document** tasks (e.g. reading comprehension, document retrieval).\n16:\n17:<p align=\"center\">\n18:  <img src=\"./figs/overview.png\" width=\"1000\" title=\"Overview of LinkBERT\" alt=\"\">\n19:</p>\n20:\n21:\n22:## 1.
