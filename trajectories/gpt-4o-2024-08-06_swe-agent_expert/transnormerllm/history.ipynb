This is the official implementation of [TransNormerLLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14995.pdf). Our opened weights of TransNormerLLM are now accessible to individuals, creators, researchers and businesses of all sizes so that they can experiment, innovate and scale their ideas responsibly.\n54:\n55:Our release contains the TransNormerLLM model implementation, the open-source weights and the starting code for Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT). We will show examples on how to load [TransNormerLLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14995.pdf) models, run SFT and inference on it.\n56:\n57:- TransNormerLLM is the first linear attention-based LLM that outperforms conventional softmax attention-based models in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. It was trained on a high-quality corpus with up to **1.4 trillion** tokens.\n58:- TransNormerLLM evolves from the previous linear attention architecture TransNormer by making advanced modifications that include LRPE positional embedding, Lightning Attention acceleration, new gating and normalization mechanisms.\n59:- TransNormerLLM achieved competitive performance of its size on multiple well-approved Chinese, English, and multi-language general and domain-specific benchmarks.\n60:- This release includes **Base** versions with **385M**, **1B**, and **7B** parameters.\n61:- All versions are fully open to academic research. Developers only need to apply via email and obtain official commercial permission to use it for free commercially.\n62:- For more information, welcome reading our academic paper [TransNormerLLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14995.pdf).\n63:- 🔥Get excited!🔥 Our **15B** model is currently in training! Click the [link](https://api.wandb.ai/links/opennlplab/kip314lq) 👀 to track our thrilling progress in real time! 🚀\n64:\n65:![](./images/TransNormerLLM-arch.png)\n66:\n67:# Released Weights\n68:\n69:The specific released versions and download links are shown as below:\n70:\n71:|                   |                                  Base Models                                   |\n72:| :---------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------: |\n73:|       385M        | 🤗 [TransNormerLLM-385M](https://huggingface.co/OpenNLPLab/TransNormerLLM-385M) |\n74:|        1B         |   🤗 [TransNormerLLM-1B](https://huggingface.co/OpenNLPLab/TransNormerLLM-1B)   |\n75:|        7B         |   🤗 [TransNormerLLM-7B](https://huggingface.co/OpenNLPLab/TransNormerLLM-7B)   |\n76:\n77:# Benchmark Results\n78:\n79:To validate TransNormerLLM, we tested our 385M, 1B, and 7B models on Commonsense Reasoning Task, MMLU, CMMLU, and C-Eval. For comparison, we selected several open-source models as competitors, including Transformer-based models such as OPT, Pythia, BLOOM, GPT-Neo, GPT-J, MPT, Falcon, LLaMA1/2, OpenLLAMA v1/v2, Baichuan 1/2, ChatGLM 1/2, and non-Transformer model RWKV. It can be observed that, compared to these models, TransNormerLLM remains highly competitive.\n80:\n81:**Commonsense Reasoning** We report BoolQ, PIQA, SIQA,\n82:HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC easy and challenge, OpenBookQA and their average. We report 0-shot results for all benchmarks using LM-Eval-Harness.\n83:All of our models achieve competitive performance compared to existing state-of-the-art LLMs, showcasing a remarkable ability to comprehend and apply commonsense reasoning.\n84:\n85:**Aggregated Benchmarks**\n86:We report the overall results for MMLU, CMMLU, C-Eval. Official scripts were used for evaluating MMLU, CMMLU, and C-Eval, with all evaluation results being conducted with a 5-shot setup. In comparison to top-tier open-source models available in the industry, our models have demonstrated matched performance in both English and Chinese benchmarks.\n87:\n88:## General Domain\n89:\n90:In the general domain, we conducted 5-shot tests on the following datasets:\n91:- [C-Eval](https://cevalbenchmark.com/index.html#home) is a comprehensive Chinese basic model evaluation dataset, covering 52 disciplines and four levels of difficulty. Our evaluation approach followed that of [LM-Evaluation-Harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness).\n92:- [MMLU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300) is an English evaluation dataset comprising 57 tasks, encompassing elementary math, American history, computer science, law, etc. The difficulty ranges from high school level to expert level. It's a mainstream LLM evaluation dataset. We used its [official](https://github.com/hendrycks/test) evaluation approach.\n93:- [CMMLU](https://github.com/haonan-li/CMMLU) is a comprehensive Chinese evaluation benchmark covering 67 topics, specifically designed to assess language models' knowledge and reasoning capabilities in a Chinese context. We adopted its [official](https://github.com/haonan-li/CMMLU) evaluation approach.\n94:\n95:\n96:### Model Results\n97:**Performance Comparison on Commonsense Reasoning and Aggregated Benchmarks.** For a fair comparison, we report competing methods' results reproduced by us using their released models.

This is the official implementation of [TransNormerLLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14995.pdf). Our opened weights of TransNormerLLM are now accessible to individuals, creators, researchers and businesses of all sizes so that they can experiment, innovate and scale their ideas responsibly.\n54:\n55:Our release contains the TransNormerLLM model implementation, the open-source weights and the starting code for Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT). We will show examples on how to load [TransNormerLLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14995.pdf) models, run SFT and inference on it.\n56:\n57:- TransNormerLLM is the first linear attention-based LLM that outperforms conventional softmax attention-based models in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. It was trained on a high-quality corpus with up to **1.4 trillion** tokens.\n58:- TransNormerLLM evolves from the previous linear attention architecture TransNormer by making advanced modifications that include LRPE positional embedding, Lightning Attention acceleration, new gating and normalization mechanisms.\n59:- TransNormerLLM achieved competitive performance of its size on multiple well-approved Chinese, English, and multi-language general and domain-specific benchmarks.\n60:- This release includes **Base** versions with **385M**, **1B**, and **7B** parameters.\n61:- All versions are fully open to academic research. Developers only need to apply via email and obtain official commercial permission to use it for free commercially.\n62:- For more information, welcome reading our academic paper [TransNormerLLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14995.pdf).\n63:- 🔥Get excited!🔥 Our **15B** model is currently in training!

For comparison, we selected several open-source models as competitors, including Transformer-based models such as OPT, Pythia, BLOOM, GPT-Neo, GPT-J, MPT, Falcon, LLaMA1/2, OpenLLAMA v1/v2, Baichuan 1/2, ChatGLM 1/2, and non-Transformer model RWKV. It can be observed that, compared to these models, TransNormerLLM remains highly competitive.\n80:\n81:**Commonsense Reasoning** We report BoolQ, PIQA, SIQA,\n82:HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC easy and challenge, OpenBookQA and their average. We report 0-shot results for all benchmarks using LM-Eval-Harness.\n83:All of our models achieve competitive performance compared to existing state-of-the-art LLMs, showcasing a remarkable ability to comprehend and apply commonsense reasoning.\n84:\n85:**Aggregated Benchmarks**\n86:We report the overall results for MMLU, CMMLU, C-Eval. Official scripts were used for evaluating MMLU, CMMLU, and C-Eval, with all evaluation results being conducted with a 5-shot setup. In comparison to top-tier open-source models available in the industry, our models have demonstrated matched performance in both English and Chinese benchmarks.\n87:\n88:## General Domain\n89:\n90:In the general domain, we conducted 5-shot tests on the following datasets:\n91:- [C-Eval](https://cevalbenchmark.com/index.html#home) is a comprehensive Chinese basic model evaluation dataset, covering 52 disciplines and four levels of difficulty. Our evaluation approach followed that of [LM-Evaluation-Harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness).\n92:- [MMLU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300) is an English evaluation dataset comprising 57 tasks, encompassing elementary math, American history, computer science, law, etc. The difficulty ranges from high school level to expert level. It's a mainstream LLM evaluation dataset. We used its [official](https://github.com/hendrycks/test) evaluation approach.\n93:- [CMMLU](https://github.com/haonan-li/CMMLU) is a comprehensive Chinese evaluation benchmark covering 67 topics, specifically designed to assess language models' knowledge and reasoning capabilities in a Chinese context. We adopted its [official](https://github.com/haonan-li/CMMLU) evaluation approach.\n94:\n95:\n96:### Model Results\n97:**Performance Comparison on Commonsense Reasoning and Aggregated Benchmarks.** For a fair comparison, we report competing methods' results reproduced by us using their released models.
