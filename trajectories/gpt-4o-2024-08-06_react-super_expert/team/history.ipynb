    "[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'Interact in a jupyter notebook to solve the request.\\nOutput a thought and an action.\\nThought can reason about the current situation, and action allows you to interact with the Jupyter notebook. There are three types of actions:\\n(1) execute, which executes a notebook cell with the command under the \"content\" field. This could be a bash command (beginning with !), a python command, or magic command (beginning with %).\\n(2) edit, which allows you to replace existing lines in a file with new lines. To replace lines, you will need to provide the lines as they appear before the replacement, and the lines to replace them with.\\nIn the \"content\" field, format should be ```{filename}\\n<<<BEFORE_EDIT>>>\\nlines before edit\\nlines before edit\\n<<<AFTER_EDIT>>>\\nlines after edit\\nlines after edit```\\n  - Include the entire lines WITH indentation. After editing, make sure indentation is correct.\\n(3) submit, which submits the final answer (or null if there\\'s no answer to submit), formatted as JSON (make sure to use double quotes for keys and values).\\nAlways output exactly one \"thought\" and one \"action\", and encapsulate the content with <content>...</content> tags.\\nI will provide the cell output (observation) for you.\\n\\nTips:\\n- When a github repository is given, you should start by cloning it. You can read the readme file and browse the repo for installation and usage instructions.\\n- Avoid using conda, instead use pip for package management.\\n- Each execution has a 5-minute timeout. After this period, you can decide whether to interrupt the kernel or continue waiting.\\n  You should interrupt if: (1) you are prompted with an interactive message (e.g., \"Do you want to continue? [Y/n]\"). In that case, you can bypass it by executing echo \"y\" | command, or (2) the execution is taking longer than expected because the wrong task is being executed, such as a different model or incorrect number of epochs.\\n  You should continue to wait if the current execution is correct and proceeding as expected.\\n\\nHere are some examples.\\nGit repository: EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness\\nQuery: Evaluate EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B on hellaswag.

       "# Two is Better than Many? Binary Classification as an Effective Approach to Multi-Choice Question Answering\n\nThe repository contains the implementation of the paper [Two is Better than Many? Binary Classification as an Effective Approach to Multi-Choice Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16495) (EMNLP 2022)\n\n## Experiments\n\nWe have created separate training scripts for each of the datasets.\n\nFor example, the DeBERTa TEAM model on the SWAG dataset can be trained as follows:\n\n```\nCUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train_swag.py --name \"microsoft/deberta-v3-large\" --epochs 5 --lr 1e-6 --shuffle\n```\n\nYou can use `--name \"roberta-large\"` to train the RoBERTa model.\n\nYou can use the appropriate training scripts for the other datasets. Running the scripts will print an `Instance Acc`, which is the main MCQA task accuracy reported in the Table 2 and 3 of our paper. For some of the datasets, you need to upload the test predictions in the [AllenAI Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.allenai.org/) to obtain the test results. The scripts provided in this repository will save the test predictions for each epoch in the appropriate experiment folders ready for upload to the leaderboard.\n\n\nThe Score models can be benchmarked using the `run_mcqa_score.py` script. The scirpt is adapted from the [HuggingFace MCQA example](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/pytorch/multiple-choice).\n\nThe DeBERTa Score model on the SWAG dataset can be trained as follows:\n```\nCUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3 python run_mcqa_score.py --learning_rate=1e-6 --num_train_epochs 5 --seed 42 \\\n--train_file=\"data/swag/mcq_train.json\" --validation_file=\"data/swag/mcq_val.json\" --test_file=\"data/swag/mcq_test.json\" \\\n--output_dir=\"saved/swag/mcq/deberta-large\" --model_name_or_path=\"microsoft/deberta-v3-large\" \\\n--per_device_train_batch_size=8 --per_device_eval_batch_size=8 --weight_decay=0.005 \\\n--do_train True --do_eval True --do_predict True --evaluation_strategy=\"epoch\" --save_strategy=\"epoch\" \\\n--report_to \"wandb\" --run_name \"DEBERTA SWAG MCQ\" --save_total_limit=1 --overwrite_output_dir\n```\n\nChange the `--train_file, --validation_file, --test_file` arguments to train and evaluate on the other datasets. Change the `--model_name_or_path` to train other models for the task.\n\n## Citation\n\nPlease cite the following paper if you find this code useful in your work.\n\n```\nTwo is Better than Many? Binary Classification as an Effective Approach to Multi-Choice Question Answering. D. Ghosal, N. Majumder, R. Mihalcea, S. Poria. EMNLP 2022.\n```"

To load only the first 10 examples, I need to modify the lines where `x1` and `x2` are defined to slice the first 10 lines. Additionally, I need to locate where the model is initialized and training parameters are set to adjust them according to the requirements. I will search for the model initialization and training parameter sections in the script."
