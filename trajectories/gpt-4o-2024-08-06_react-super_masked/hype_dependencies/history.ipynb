    "[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'Interact in a jupyter notebook to solve the request.\\nOutput a thought and an action.\\nThought can reason about the current situation, and action allows you to interact with the Jupyter notebook. There are three types of actions:\\n(1) execute, which executes a notebook cell with the command under the \"content\" field. This could be a bash command (beginning with !), a python command, or magic command (beginning with %).\\n(2) edit, which allows you to replace existing lines in a file with new lines. To replace lines, you will need to provide the lines as they appear before the replacement, and the lines to replace them with.\\nIn the \"content\" field, format should be ```{filename}\\n<<<BEFORE_EDIT>>>\\nlines before edit\\nlines before edit\\n<<<AFTER_EDIT>>>\\nlines after edit\\nlines after edit```\\n  - Include the entire lines WITH indentation. After editing, make sure indentation is correct.\\n(3) submit, which submits the final answer (or null if there\\'s no answer to submit), formatted as JSON (make sure to use double quotes for keys and values).\\nAlways output exactly one \"thought\" and one \"action\", and encapsulate the content with <content>...</content> tags.\\nI will provide the cell output (observation) for you.\\n\\nTips:\\n- When a github repository is given, you should start by cloning it. You can read the readme file and browse the repo for installation and usage instructions.\\n- Avoid using conda, instead use pip for package management.\\n- Each execution has a 5-minute timeout. After this period, you can decide whether to interrupt the kernel or continue waiting.\\n  You should interrupt if: (1) you are prompted with an interactive message (e.g., \"Do you want to continue? [Y/n]\"). In that case, you can bypass it by executing echo \"y\" | command, or (2) the execution is taking longer than expected because the wrong task is being executed, such as a different model or incorrect number of epochs.\\n  You should continue to wait if the current execution is correct and proceeding as expected.\\n\\nHere are some examples.\\nGit repository: EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness\\nQuery: Evaluate EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B on hellaswag.

       "\n# HyPe: Better PLM Fine-tuning with Hidden Representation Perturbation\n\n\n## Overviews\n\nThis is the repository for ACL2023 main conference paper: **HyPe** (HyPe: Better Pre-trained Language Model Fine-tuning with Hidden Representation Perturbation). You can find our paper on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08853) or on [ACL Anthology](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.182/).\n\nLanguage models with the Transformers structure have shown great performance in natural language processing.\nHowever, there still poses problems when fine-tuning pre-trained language models on downstream tasks, such as over-fitting or representation collapse.\nIn this work, we propose HyPe, a simple yet effective fine-tuning technique to alleviate such problems by perturbing hidden representations of Transformers layers. Unlike previous works that only add noise to inputs or parameters, we argue that the hidden representations of Transformers layers convey more diverse and meaningful language information. \nTherefore, making the Transformers layers more robust to hidden representation perturbations can further benefit the fine-tuning of PLMs en bloc.\nWe conduct extensive experiments and analyses on GLUE and other natural language inference datasets. Results demonstrate that HyPe outperforms vanilla fine-tuning and enhances generalization of hidden representations from different layers. In addition, HyPe acquires negligible computational overheads, and is better than and compatible with previous state-of-the-art fine-tuning techniques.\n\n<center>\n    <a target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"border-radius: 0.3125em;\n    box-shadow: 0 2px 4px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.12),0 2px 10px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.08);\"\n    src=\"./overview.PNG\"></a>\n    <br>\n    <div style=\"color:orange; border-bottom: 1px solid #d9d9d9;\n    display: inline-block;\n    color: #999;\n    padding: 2px;\">Method Overview.</div>\n</center>\n\n## Requirements\n\n- python==3.7\n- cuda==10.1\n- torch==1.8.0\n\n- transformers==4.7.0\n- datasets==1.6.0\n- scikit-learn==0.24.2\n\n## How to train and evaluate using HyPe\n\nYou can use the following Shell script to run HyPe fine-tuning on GLUE benchmark.\n\n```\nmkdir ./final_results\n\nGPU=<your GPU id>\nOUTPUT_DIR=<your output directory path>\nMODEL=<your PLM to fine-tune>\nTASK=rte\nBATCHSIZE=16\nEPOCH=3.0\nLR=2e-5\nSEED=42\n\nCUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=${GPU} python main.py \\\n        --adam_epsilon 1e-6 \\\n        --max_seq_length 128 \\\n        --eval_accumulation_steps 20 \\\n        --do_eval \\\n        --do_train \\\n        --warmup_ratio 0.1 \\\n        --weight_decay 0.01 \\\n        --save_total_limit 1 \\\n        --save_steps 30000 \\\n        --model_name_or_path ${MODEL} \\\n        --task_name ${TASK} \\\n        --per_device_train_batch_size ${BATCHSIZE} \\\n        --learning_rate ${LR} \\\n        --num_train_epochs ${EPOCH} \\\n        --seed ${SEED} \\\n        --output_dir ${OUTPUT_DIR} \\\n        --low_resource \\\n        --dropout_rate 0.0 \\\n        --hype_type uniform \\\n        --hype_eps 1e-5 \\\n\n```\n\nYou can modify the following three args to explore different settings of HyPe:\n- --hype_type # should be one of {normal, uniform}\n- --hype_eps\n\n## Citation\nIf you find our work useful, please cite:\n\n```\n@inproceedings{yuan-etal-2023-hype,\n    title = \"{H}y{P}e: Better Pre-trained Language Model Fine-tuning with Hidden Representation Perturbation\",\n    author = \"Yuan, Hongyi  and\n      Yuan, Zheng  and\n      Tan, Chuanqi  and\n      Huang, Fei  and\n      Huang, Songfang\",\n    booktitle = \"Proceedings of the 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)\",\n    month = jul,\n    year = \"2023\",\n    address = \"Toronto, Canada\",\n    publisher = \"Association for Computational Linguistics\",\n    url = \"https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.182\",\n    pages = \"3246--3264\",\n    abstract = \"Language models with the Transformers structure have shown great performance in natural language processing.However, there still poses problems when fine-tuning pre-trained language models on downstream tasks, such as over-fitting or representation collapse.In this work, we propose HyPe, a simple yet effective fine-tuning technique to alleviate such problems by perturbing hidden representations of Transformers layers.
