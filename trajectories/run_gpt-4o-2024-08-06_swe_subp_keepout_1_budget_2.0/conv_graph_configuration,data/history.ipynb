If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly.

    "First I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory. Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.\n",
    "```\n",
    "!ls -a\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\n",
    "If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command. \n",
    "You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\n",

However, existing datasets are often limited in size con- sidering the complexity of the dialogues. Additionally, conventional training signal in- ference is not suitable for non-deterministic agent behavior, namely, considering multiple actions as valid in identical dialogue states. We propose the Conversation Graph (ConvGraph), a graph-based representation of dialogues that can be exploited for data augmentation, multi- reference training and evaluation of non- deterministic agents. ConvGraph generates novel dialogue paths to augment data volume and diversity. Intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation across three datasets shows that data augmentation and/or multi-reference training with ConvGraph can improve dialogue success rates by up to 6.4\\\\%.}\",\n15:    issn = {2307-387X},\n16:    doi = {10.1162/tacl_a_00352},\n17:    url = {https://doi.org/10.1162/tacl\\_a\\_00352},\n18:    eprint = {https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article-pdf/doi/10.1162/tacl\\_a\\_00352/1923936/tacl\\_a\\_00352.pdf},\n19:}\n20:```\n21:\n22:#### Getting Started\n23:\n24:- Download **MultiWOZ** from the [ConvLab](https://github.com/ConvLab/ConvLab/tree/master/data/multiwoz) website (required files: test.json.zip, val.json.zip, train.json.zip) and place them (unzipped) into the `multiwoz` folder\n25:- Download the **M2M/Self-Play** (train.json, dev.json, test.json) datasets for [restaurant](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/simulated-dialogue/tree/master/sim-R) and [movie](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/simulated-dialogue/tree/master/sim-M) and place them into the `self_play/restaurant` and `self_play/movie` folders, respectively.\n26:- Create a conda environment with **conda create -n convgraph python==3.7**\n27:- Activate it with **conda activate convgraph**\n28:- Install pytorch with something like **conda install pytorch==1.7.0 torchvision==0.8.1 torchaudio==0.7.0 cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch**\n29:- Then do **pip install -r requirements.txt** to get the rest of the packages...\n30:- You're good to go! :)\n31:\n32:#### Running Code\n33:\n34:- You can run all experiments for MultiWOZ from within `multiwoz/evaluation.py`\n35:- For Machines2Machines data, use `self_play/evaluation.py`\n36:- You can adjust the hyperparameters at the top of each evaluation file\n37:  - For example, you can change `history`, `dataset`, `train_with_soft_loss`, `max_epochs`, `max_val_f1`, `patience`\n38:  - The default values used in the paper are given but feel free to tune further\n39:- For different baselines and setups, uncomment the code inside each comment block, for example... \n40:- To run MFS only:\n41:```\n42:# data augmentation training only\n43:x_train, y_train = train_graph.generate_augmented_data()\n44:```\n45:- To run the base model:\n46:```\n47:# baseline training\n48:x_train, y_train = train_graph.generate_standard_data(unique=False)\n49:```\n50:- To run the MFS+Baseline model:\n51:```\n52:# data augmentation + baseline training\n53:x_t, y_t = train_graph.generate_augmented_data()\n54:x_train, y_train = train_graph.generate_standard_data(unique=False)\n55:x_train = np.concatenate((x_train, x_t))\n56:y_train = np.concatenate((y_train, y_t))\n57:```  \n58:\n59:- We hope the comments in each file will be self-explanatory\n60:- Run experiments with several seeds to obtain a stable average (M2M data only)\n61:\n62:##### Paper Links\n63:\n64:- [MIT Press](https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.1162/tacl_a_00352/97777/Conversation-Graph-Data-Augmentation-Training-and) for the journal publication, presented at [ACL 2021](https://aclanthology.org/2021.tacl-1.3/) :)\n65:\n66:##### Extrinsic Evaluation\n67:\n68:- We used [ConvLab 1.0](https://github.com/ConvLab/ConvLab) to evaluate the models using their [user simulator](https://github.com/ConvLab/ConvLab#evaluation)\n69:- Warning: It is not the easiest software to use, be patient\n70:- If you have trouble with running extrinsic evaluation, email my colleague gerasimos-dot-lampouras-at-huawei-dot-com!\n71:【This open source project is not an official Huawei product, Huawei is not expected to provide support for this project.】\n"
